This Application is a easy to host website/API that is used as a Billing Management Software. Hosted on Heroku, the user is given a choice to enter the name of an item, followed by choosing a category to which the item belongs to, from 5 options.
The user then adds the quantity and the price of the items, Adds the item to a "Cart" and then allows the user to add more items
Once the user has added sufficient number of items, they can generate the bill which shows how much each item costed, its tax based on category and if discount is applied.
